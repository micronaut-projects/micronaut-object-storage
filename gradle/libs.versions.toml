#
# This file is used to declare the list of libraries
# which are used as dependencies in the project.
# See https://docs.gradle.org/7.4.2/userguide/platforms.html#sub:central-declaration-of-dependencies
#
# For Micronaut, we have 3 kinds of dependencies:
#   - managed dependencies, which are exposed to consumers via a BOM (or version catalog)
#   - managed BOMs, which are imported into the BOM that we generate
#   - all other dependencies, which are implementation details
#
# If a library needs to appear in the BOM of the project, then it must be
# declared with the "managed-" prefix.
# If a BOM needs to be imported in the BOM of the project, then it must be
# declared with the "boms-" prefix.
# Both managed dependencies and BOMs need to have their version declared via
# a managed version (a version which alias starts with "managed-"
