To use https://aws.amazon.com/s3/[Amazon S3], you need the following dependency:

dependency:io.micronaut.objectstorage:micronaut-object-storage-aws[version={version}]

Refer to the https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-aws/latest/guide[Micronaut AWS documentation] for more
information about credentials and region configuration.

The object storage specific configuration options available are:

include::{includedir}configurationProperties/io.micronaut.objectstorage.aws.AwsS3Configuration.adoc[]

For example:

.`src/main/resources/application-ec2.yml`
[source,yaml]
----
include::doc-examples/example-java/src/test/resources/application-ec2.yml[]
----

To use it, inject a bean of type `ObjectStorageOperations<PutObjectRequest.Builder, PutObjectResponse>`.

If you have multiple buckets, use the name qualifier in the injection point `@Named("default") ObjectStorageOperations<PutObjectRequest.Builder, PutObjectResponse>`.
